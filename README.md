Repository for a Primary school app

## Building the iOS app

Building the app requires CocoaPods.

When looking into running this code yourself, you will need a Parse.com account. Enter you API details from Parse.com by copying the setEnv-example.sh to setEnv.sh and edit the resulting file with your own credentials.

After setting your credentials in the said setEnv.sh file, run all curl scripts in the cloudcode project.
